# openscad-models

This repository contains OpenSCAD models I created for various purposes and want to share with the public.
The models may be related or unrelated, they may have external dependencies (but I like to prevent that)
and they might be from totally different realms.
Please refer to the `README`s in the subdirectories for actual information on the respective models.

As of June 2025, I use the official OpenSCAD 2021.1 for design.
This is the baseline version for the models published here.

## Projects

The license for the models published here is usually [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en) unless specified differently for certain models.

## History

I started 3D printing and designing by the end of 2023.
I created a number of models over time which I partly published on platforms like Printables.
So far, I used my local version control for the files.

As time went by and the number of my models increased, I wanted to have a better way of publishing
the OpenSCAD source files and especially of their version control.
So I decided to create this repository on Github which contains all this stuff
and makes it available to the public.

Have fun!
