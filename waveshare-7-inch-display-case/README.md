They are held together with four M3x16 screws and M3R rectangular nuts,
both nut heights fit. These screws also hold the display itself in place
and keep it between the two halfs of the case.

The case is printed without any supports. It uses 45° overhangs at the critical elements
which should be printed cleanly by any decent 3D printer. You might want to use 40% infill.
